### Project Overview

You're working as a healthcare data analyst tasked with uncovering meaningful patterns and insights from hospital performance and patient feedback across the United States. Your analysis will help stakeholders understand trends in quality, satisfaction, mortality, and accessibility.

You can explore any combination of statistical methods, data cleaning, SQL analysis, and visualization. You can even create a dashboard.

---

### Suggested Questions to Explore

- Which hospital types are most common across regions?
- How do hospital ratings vary by ownership or region?
- Are certain types of hospitals associated with higher patient satisfaction?
- How does emergency service availability vary across states?
- Which states have the highest/lowest performing hospitals?
- Are there patterns in readmission rates or mortality scores?

---

### What Should Be Included

**Data Cleaning**

- Handle missing data
- Rename or format confusing column names
- Clean text-based inconsistencies

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Use basic Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly)
- Include 5–7 visualizations (e.g., bar, pie, boxplot, line, heatmap)

**Insight Generation**

- Describe trends, patterns, or anomalies observed
- You can use simple metrics or deeper statistical observations
- Make interpretations in context (e.g., “Public hospitals in state X…”)

**Optional Add-ons**

- Use SQL to support your analysis
- Apply statistical methods (T-test, correlation, distribution comparison)
- Create a basic dashboard using Plotly Dash or Streamlit

### Team Collaboration

- **Team Size:** 3 members
- Split tasks clearly (cleaning, EDA, insights, visualization, optional dashboard)

---
